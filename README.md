# Final Project

For the final project you will submit a proposal for a work of your own choosing. You can can expand on ideas covered in previous work, artists discussed in class, or ideas or something completely different. Your project should incorporate the techniques at the foundation of this semesters work (HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript) but the is otherwise up to you. This project will be the focus of the second half of the semester and therefore should be significantly greater in scope than any of the previous projects. 

In addition to the final critique you will submit a proposal and working critique. Your proposal should include a one paragraph written summary, a one sentence description, a map or diagram of the website. For technical aspects of your project you should include a list of functional parts or features that the work will have.

  * One sentence description of the project.
  * Map or diagram of the project (webpages, screens, views etc.) Other sketches are welcome.
